## School_District_Analysis
# Project Overview
The project aims to analyze and gather data information about fifteen different schools. Using Pandas, the grades, school sizes, district, and charter; the average percentage of students who passed math and reading, and the average overall percentage, school types were gathered. Additionally,  a new DataFrame with the averages and percentages, based on the spending bins, to show how school spending affects score averages and passing rates was created. In Thomas High School's analysis, academic dishonesty was discovered in the reading and math grades of Ninth Grader.For this reason, the grades for this group was replaced with NANs and the analysis was performed again.
